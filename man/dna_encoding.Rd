\title{Encode equal-length DNA strings into positional factor features}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector of DNA strings composed only of A, T, C, and G,
all of the same length.}
}
\value{
A data frame where:
  - Columns are named nt_pos1, nt_pos2, …, nt_posN
  - Each column is a factor with levels c("A","T","C","G")
}
\description{
Given a set of DNA sequences (e.g., 5-mers) composed of A/T/C/G with the same length,
this function splits them by position and encodes each base as a factor
(levels = A, T, C, G). The resulting columns are named nt_pos1 to nt_posN.
}
\details{
The function does not check the validity of the bases automatically;
please ensure all input strings use uppercase A/T/C/G and have identical lengths.
}
\examples{
# Minimal example for encoding 5-mers
dna_encoding(c("ATCGA", "GGGTT"))
